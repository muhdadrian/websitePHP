<?php
// Two ways to connect to MySQL Database:
// 1. MySQLi Extension
// 2. PDO (PHP Data Objects) -> many developers preferred this over MySQLi because it can connect to more than just MySQL Database such as:

// 1.MySQL
// 2.PostgreSQL
// 3.Oracle
// 4.Firebird
// 5.MS SQL Server
// 6.Sybase
// 7.Informix
// 8.IBM
// 9.FreeTDS
//10.SQLite
//11.Cubrid
//12.4D

//However you need to know OOP

// As a beginner we stick to the first one -> MySQLi as its procedural

// Make sure Apache and MySQL is running/started

//Then type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in the URL

// next check at 97
